Received a new csv of ADNI covariates cleaned by our collaborator: ./ADNI_Prepped_for_Harmonization_Fall2023_Release_Covariates_Only.csv
Randomly sampled some rows and verified that the age matches with the one in the csv previously converted by myself.

More demographic information (but no dictionary):
- `Subject Demographics [ADNI1,GO,2,3]`: ./Subject_Characteristics/Subject_Demographics/PTDEMOG_30Aug2023.csv

Spreadsheet useful for mapping (and turns out to contain all information we will need):
- ./ADNI_MRI_T1.csv

Subscores of the test (might be interesting to analyze):
- `ADAS Sub-Scores and Total Scores [ADNI1]`: ./Assessments/Neuropsychological/ADASSCORES_30Aug2023.csv
