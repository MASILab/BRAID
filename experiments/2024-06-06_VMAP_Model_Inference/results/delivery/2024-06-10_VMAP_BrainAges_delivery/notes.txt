- age_pred_dbn: estimated brain age by DeepBrainNet (years).
- age_pred_dbn_bc: estimated brain age by DeepBrainNet (years), after bias correction.
- age_pred_wm_age_affine: estimated brain age (years) by WM age affine, described in the BRAID paper.
- age_pred_wm_age_affine_bc: estimated brain age (years) by WM age affine, described in the BRAID paper, after bias correction.
- age_pred_wm_age_nonrigid: estimated brain age (years) by WM age nonrigid, described in the BRAID paper.

Others:
- fold-*: WM age nonrigid and WM age affine were trained with 5-fold cross validation. Therefore, we have five trained models for each.
